## __Unit Testing in Javascript__  
from https://github.com/mawrkus/js-unit-testing-guide

**Ideally use TDD (Test Driven Development)**
  1. Write a simple failing test
  2. Make the test pass by writing the minimum amount of code
  3. Refactor the code by applying design principles/patterns

**NEVER comment out tests** - Either fix or remove [*](https://github.com/mawrkus/js-unit-testing-guide#dont-comment-out-tests)

- Tests names should begin with `should...`, and ideally should be structured based on functionality
