# JavaScript Fun Times

A repository for practicing and playing around with JavaScript. I will store any small apps and problem solutions that I create with  no larger use. It will also contain my test projects for libraries, and practice setups where I combine and test these libraries/ configs for better understanding.

## [playground](play/)
  Contains projects for testing and playing with specific libraries and the functions they provide


## practice
  Contains small setup applications for frameworks or multiple libraries that I use to help build my understanding of the full build stack and initilization processes


## sol
  Contains Applications that solve specific problems, asked by interviews or just developed by me to practice problem solving
