# Quick React Tests

Testing out the React UI Framework. Created with `create-react-app`.

Example of updating clock component, as well as an input + list component and a quick mockup of a login interface.

The scripts in `node_modules/react-scripts/scripts` are useful for explaining what happens when npm scripts are run. The webpack config files in `node_modules/react-scripts/config` are good starting places for creating my own react build.

**ToDo:**  
[ ] Look into `src/registerServiceWorker.js`  


## Usage

`npm run start` to run development server on port 3001. Hot development, so page will automatically refresh on file save.

`npm run build` to create production ready build in the `build` directory
