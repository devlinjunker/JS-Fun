# JavaScript Playground

These are the test projects I create for exploring libraries and build tools. I will attempt to create a README for each project that I create, so that returning and reviewing what I've done will be easier.

## [Docsify](/play/test.docsify/docs/)
 Quick Web Server and Markdown framework for hosting documentation. This will be used to host most of my notes for some of these projects. However I will also likely use ESDoc for hosting (although it generates static pages vs dynamic with docsify, so I will have to look into this)
