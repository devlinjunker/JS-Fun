# JavaScript Playground

These are the test projects I create for exploring libraries and build tools. I will attempt to create a README for each project that I create, so that returning and reviewing what I've done will be easier.

[Node/NPM Test](/play/test.npm/)


## Testing
[Notes](/NOTES/test.md)

### [Mocha](/play/test.mocha/)
  Test project for the Mocha framework for JavaScript Unit tests.

### [Karma](/play/test.karma/)
  Basic Tests with Karma Framework running Mocha tests on Chrome and Firefox for a webpack project

## Documentation
[Notes](/NOTES/doc.md)

### [Docsify](/play/test.docsify/docs/)
 Quick Web Server and Markdown framework for hosting documentation. This will be used to host most of my notes for some of these projects. However I will also likely use ESDoc for hosting (although it generates static pages vs dynamic with docsify, so I will have to look into this)

### [ESDoc](/play/test.esdoc/)
  Using ESDoc to generate static pages for JavaScript project code and test documentation. This is an example of those pages and a few usage examples.



## Build Tools
[Notes](/NOTES/build.md)

### [Webpack](/play/test.webpack/)
  Basic Web Application Project with Webpack (Babel/ES6 + Local Dev Server)

### [Babel](/play/test.babel/)
 Playing around with babel compilation. Example application and testing ecma6 classes.

### [ESLint](/play/test.eslint/)
 Finding the rules that match my style of JavaScript coding.

### [Flow](/play/test.flow/)
  Practice with Flow Static Typing

### [Prettier](/play/test.prettier/)
  Using Prettier for opinionated code formatting in file



## Frameworks
[Notes](/NOTES/framework.md)

### [React](/play/test.react/)
  Testing React UI Components. Based on the react template application with scripts and webpack configs worth exploring.

### [Winston](/play/test.winston/)
  Logging with Winston Loggers for files or console
